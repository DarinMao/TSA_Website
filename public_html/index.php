				Mission To Mars - Announcements
			</h2>
			<p>We'll be putting announcements here as we need them.
			<p>PLEASE DO RESEARCH. NO MORE CODING UNTIL THIS IS FINISHED
			<p>To Do List:
			
			<ul>
				<li>Research</li>
				<li>Style the banner (does not display properly on some wide screens, and also needs to be responsive)</li>
				<li>Create system for displaying timeline events from JSON file (this will make adding and editing events easier)</li>
