			<h2>
				Mission To Mars - Announcements
			</h2>
		</div>
			<p>We'll be putting announcements here as we need them.
			<p>PLEASE DO RESEARCH. NO MORE CODING UNTIL THIS IS FINISHED
			<p>We might need a dropdown menu for certain things. For example, the main "career field" page would link to
				the other main articles for each individual career fields. Similar idea for interviews.
