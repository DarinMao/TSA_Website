00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.497
DARIN: Okay Rob

00:00:03.497 --> 00:00:09.179
So, we have here today Mr. Rob

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.969
Chalmers, could you tell us a little bit

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.559
more about your job, what you do every

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.340
day um and how it contributes to space

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.980
exploration?

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.140
ROB: Sure, I work here at Goddard

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.279
Space Flight Center in Greenbelt

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.514
Maryland

00:00:25.014 --> 00:00:28.680
We're one of a bunch of NASA

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.460
field centers scattered around the

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:39.540
country, and Goddard's mission is to is

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:48.149
generally concentrated on in low Earth

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.360
orbit either looking at Earth, Earth

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.570
resources or climate change or things

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.500
happening in the oceans, or looking out at

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.930
space targets you know the Hubble

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.110
Space Telescope, James Webb Space

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.979
Telescope under development. And the

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.630
specific mission I'm working on right

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.950
now is a payload that's going to be

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.930
delivered to the ISS, the International

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.259
Space Station and from that vantage

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.549
point it will look down at Earth as it

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.920
as the Space Station over flies the earth

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.780
and using a lidar system which is a

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.240
laser-based ranging system it will

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.049
measure the height and density of forest

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.899
canopy which is so that it'll produce a

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.070
map of the Earth, information about the

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.380
Earth's forests, and with that

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.360
information the scientists can estimate

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.810
how much of a carbon sink exists in the

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.570
world's forests which is important for

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.659
understanding the overall carbon cycle

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.899
the how carbon dioxide from the

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.780
atmosphere is stored in vegetation

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.100
and as well as an other carbon sinks in

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.110
the world in the oceans and elsewhere

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.250
and so it's a mission called "GEDI", "GEDI"

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.230
with a "G", "G-E-D-I" and it's expected to

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.350
launch at the end of 2018 or

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.740
early 2019.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.314
DARIN: Alright so

00:02:38.314 --> 00:02:40.989
ROB: Hold on I'm oh uh

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:46.390
...

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.000
...

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.250
...

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.370
...

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.040
...

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.730
ROB: My apologies

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.609
had a delivery just

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:05.040
DARIN: Yeah no it's fine.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.819
Yeah so now we'll move into some

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.850
more Mars related questions, so first off

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.010
Why do you believe it's important to

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.050
explore Mars so what benefits to society

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.760
are there?

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.000
ROB: I haven't given it very much

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.989
thought really I think you know in

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.200
general it's uh it's the kind of human

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.880
quest for knowledge and trying to

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:33.579
understand how the universe has evolved, how planets

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:35.799
have changed over time, the environments

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:38.470
of you know on Mars for example there's

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.150
pretty clear evidence that at one time

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.700
in the history of Mars there was flowing

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.760
water on the surface and so there's just

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.299
a natural curiosity of whether whether

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:51.190
it's supported life at some point in the

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.510
past whether this potentially life

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.519
existing in some form perhaps under the

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:00.340
surface you know even if it's bacterial

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:06.100
or microbial life. So science is

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:11.890
generally about trying to understand our

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.549
our environment and then from that

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:22.150
understanding a lot of times we we are

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:27.200
able to advance our own technologies and

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:35.660
and make make advancements that

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.760
generally contribute to humanity's

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.260
progress I think ultimately the

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.620
expectation is that in the future we

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.770
will be traveling to the near nearby

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.090
planets perhaps creating colonies

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.890
hopefully not in response to destroying

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:01.160
our own planet, we'll have to see there's quite a

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.640
lot of science fiction about

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:10.280
about the impetus for leaving our planet

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.980
in some cases that's because of

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.190
disasters here at home in other cases

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:22.880
just to find resources for example just

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.840
spread humanity out into the solar

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.200
system.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.180
DARIN: Alright so many organizations

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.100
have already made it clear that human

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.740
astronauts will eventually reach Mars so

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.410
when do you think human astronauts will

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:46.910
reach Mars like a year like 2025, 2030

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.240
maybe?

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:54.170
ROB: Well yeah it's tough to say there

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:58.430
are a lot of obstacles to to returning

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.740
astronauts I mean that there's a you're

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.210
probably familiar with a one-way

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:06.620
expedition being proposed in Europe I

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.240
don't know how seriously people are

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.840
taking it but they are proposing to send

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.620
people on a one-way trip to to Mars in

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:22.370
about the 2025 time frame but for the

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:26.330
more I think more serious efforts to

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.630
send explorers to Mars and return them

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:33.920
safely I imagine the time frame is even

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:39.680
further out perhaps 2030 so certainly

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.969
within your lifetime

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:44.269
I would think. There are a lot of

00:06:44.269 --> 00:06:48.169
difficulties it's a you know an order of

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:50.539
magnitude if not more more difficult to

00:06:50.539 --> 00:06:52.219
get to Mars than it was to go to the moon

00:06:52.219 --> 00:06:59.179
being as far away as it is and requiring

00:06:59.179 --> 00:07:02.599
you know missions that are at least a

00:07:02.599 --> 00:07:07.849
year long not being able to turn around

00:07:07.849 --> 00:07:10.189
and route if there are any problems

00:07:10.189 --> 00:07:12.019
basically having to be committed to

00:07:12.019 --> 00:07:14.089
going all the way to Mars and looping

00:07:14.089 --> 00:07:16.610
around and coming back because our

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:18.889
propulsion technology is just not

00:07:18.889 --> 00:07:20.509
capable of doing anything other than

00:07:20.509 --> 00:07:24.949
that so and then there's the radiation

00:07:24.949 --> 00:07:27.769
exposure which is a major concern for

00:07:27.769 --> 00:07:31.399
any long term travel outside of the

00:07:31.399 --> 00:07:35.239
Earth's magnetosphere so there are a lot

00:07:35.239 --> 00:07:37.699
of obstacles to getting there quickly

00:07:37.699 --> 00:07:44.629
and I think the methodological approach

00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:47.929
a kind of stepping stone approach going

00:07:47.929 --> 00:07:50.929
to maybe near-earth asteroids first

00:07:50.929 --> 00:07:55.909
going back to the Moon are are kind of

00:07:55.909 --> 00:07:58.819
stepping stone goals intended to address

00:07:58.819 --> 00:08:03.559
those problems and solve them prior to

00:08:03.559 --> 00:08:06.499
actually going on the huge undertaking

00:08:06.499 --> 00:08:08.149
of sending somebody all the way to Mars.

00:08:08.149 --> 00:08:13.549
DARIN: Alright so you mentioned radiation

00:08:13.549 --> 00:08:16.459
briefly there um so obviously Mars is

00:08:16.459 --> 00:08:18.259
not Earth and it's different in many

00:08:18.259 --> 00:08:21.049
ways so what special problems might

00:08:21.049 --> 00:08:24.289
Mar pose to the long-term health of

00:08:24.289 --> 00:08:27.429
the human astronauts?

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:31.460
ROB: Just getting there is is is a really big

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:33.320
hurdle because of the length of time

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:37.339
involved and need to recycle resources

00:08:37.339 --> 00:08:43.909
water for example the the radiation

00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:46.490
environment encountered on the way to

00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:49.370
Mars and Mars itself as you probably know Mars

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:53.149
has a very little magnetic field so

00:08:53.149 --> 00:08:57.290
there's no real protective layer around

00:08:57.290 --> 00:09:01.190
Mars like Earth has to prevent cosmic

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:03.260
radiation for reaching the surface and

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:07.850
so even even once humans on the surface

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:09.500
of Mars they're still going to encounter

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:13.730
this very heavy radiation exposure and

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:14.990
they need to be protected from that

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:18.829
especially for such long missions so

00:09:18.829 --> 00:09:20.660
there are concepts for doing that some

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:26.360
of them involve surrounding the putting

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:28.700
the astronauts inside of a protective,

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:32.029
you know, spacecraft that has where they

00:09:32.029 --> 00:09:35.959
use water as a radiation absorber because it

00:09:35.959 --> 00:09:38.540
happens to be pretty good at that and

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:40.699
they need to carry the water in any

00:09:40.699 --> 00:09:46.130
event for the astronauts to use.

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:46.630
You know

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:50.510
perhaps they would use something similar on the on the surface of Mars as well.

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:55.579
Those are kind of the thoughts that

00:09:55.579 --> 00:09:57.470
occur to me I mean certainly have not

00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:01.310
much expertise and kind of brainstorming

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:04.459
the problems and possible solutions for

00:10:04.459 --> 00:10:09.740
for any astronaut visits to Mars.

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:14.480
DARIN: Alright so I I understand you've worked on the

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.640
Curiosity rover is that correct

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:17.480
ROB: Yeah I

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:20.779
worked on one of the payloads on

00:10:20.779 --> 00:10:24.589
Curiosity called SAM, Sample Analysis on

00:10:24.589 --> 00:10:25.089
Mars.

00:10:25.089 --> 00:10:29.089
DARIN: So what scientific operations

00:10:29.089 --> 00:10:31.850
do you think are the most important on

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:34.820
Mars that rovers like Curiosity could

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:38.529
not complete that humans can?

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:41.990
ROB: Yeah you're breaking up a little bit I

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:45.050
think you asked about what kind of

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:48.680
science like that would rovers such as

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:52.560
curiosity be doing?

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:55.940
DARIN: No um I said um what

00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:58.280
operations would humans be able to do

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:00.650
that rovers like Curiosity could not do?

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:05.090
ROB: Could not do well that's

00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:07.310
ETHAN: As in like

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:10.480
ROB: Yes?

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:12.500
ETHAN: As in like why would we need to

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.870
send humans to Mars like what what would

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:17.280
be

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:19.850
ROB: That's a you know that's a you know

00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:24.830
worthy topic for discussion I guess the

00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:30.980
usual response is that humans provide a

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:42.620
lot of sort of capability that that is

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:45.620
simply provided by their presence it's

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:53.780
very hard to program a robotic explorer that can explore at

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:55.670
all comparable to what a human could do

00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:59.360
certainly you know there there are

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:03.260
huge advantages to not having to return

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:07.490
your explorer back to Earth I mean that

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:10.940
and you know that's fundamentally why

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:14.990
the trips to Mars have all been one-way

00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:19.130
trips simply because it's hugely cheaper

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:22.880
than actually having to return the payload back

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:27.800
to Earth. So I think expense and risk

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:32.210
have been the major reasons why humans

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:38.780
have not been sent to Mars up till now

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:42.230
and you know technology kind of kind of

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:45.860
continues to advance at a pace you know

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:48.620
that sort of matches the funding levels

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:52.970
that are provided but uh

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:54.829
A lot of capability can be built into

00:12:54.829 --> 00:12:57.560
robotic explorers like you see on

00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:02.480
Curiosity you know ExoMars rovers being

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:05.149
developed I guess there's a Mars 2020

00:13:05.149 --> 00:13:10.279
mission as well these are all robotic

00:13:10.279 --> 00:13:15.170
missions and there are plans for sample

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:19.490
return mission which certainly predate

00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:24.840
sending humans there.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:28.370
DARIN: Alright so

00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:30.470
there's a lot of supplies that the

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:32.120
astronauts will need so like food,

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:35.300
water things like that so how will these

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:39.529
supplies be taken to Mars so will they be

00:13:39.529 --> 00:13:41.839
sent in advance or I don't know

00:13:41.839 --> 00:13:43.677
something else?

00:13:43.677 --> 00:13:46.250
ROB: Yeah I don't know I I

00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:48.019
suspect you know that what little I've

00:13:48.019 --> 00:13:50.089
kind of read on what the sort of

00:13:50.089 --> 00:13:54.439
thinking is is that there would be most

00:13:54.439 --> 00:13:56.509
likely missions sent in advance that

00:13:56.509 --> 00:14:00.110
carry supplies and kind of pre-deploy

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:02.899
things on the surface facilities as well

00:14:02.899 --> 00:14:07.550
you know habitat module perhaps there

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:10.519
there would be actually things put into

00:14:10.519 --> 00:14:17.120
low-Earth orbit initially so that a full

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:25.850
mission system is preassembled in a

00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:29.180
lower orbit and then the astronauts

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:31.490
would be delivered to that that vehicle

00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:34.910
in turn would would be sent on it's way to

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:39.860
Mars. And those are just kind of means to

00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:42.139
to deal with sort of our own

00:14:42.139 --> 00:14:46.220
technological limitations to make it

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:51.620
possible. There's a lot of things in

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:56.540
Science-Fiction that we kind that makes

00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:58.279
things look very easy when in fact that

00:14:58.279 --> 00:15:04.309
with our current technologies, one of them is the the easy way

00:15:04.309 --> 00:15:07.220
in science fiction space vehicles seem

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:09.649
to be able to stop on a dime, turn around,

00:15:09.649 --> 00:15:12.470
and have unlimited amounts of propulsion,

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:17.300
unlimited amounts of energy to just, you

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:19.970
know, zigzag and maneuver and go any

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:22.370
which way they'd like to go, but in fact

00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:24.470
with our present, you know, chemical

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:27.920
propulsion technology we have to plan it

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:30.949
all in advance and you have kind of one

00:15:30.949 --> 00:15:35.449
shot one trajectory you can follow to

00:15:35.449 --> 00:15:38.480
get to get to a destination such as Mars

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:44.480
and it makes for kind of a very scripted

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:47.569
mission it doesn't have much room at all

00:15:47.569 --> 00:15:49.809
for any problems that might occur.

00:15:49.809 --> 00:15:56.839
DARIN: Alright so there's many groups out there

00:15:56.839 --> 00:16:01.220
that aim to put humans on Mars so like

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:04.430
SpaceX, Mars Society, things like that so

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:06.980
is there any one group do you think that

00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:10.040
has an advantage over the other ones in

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:13.640
any way so far?

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:18.559
ROB: I probably won't give

00:16:18.559 --> 00:16:20.120
a good answer on that question simply

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:22.339
because it's not my place as a

00:16:22.339 --> 00:16:24.889
government employed to make comments on

00:16:24.889 --> 00:16:28.430
what private ventures are doing there

00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:30.769
there are clearly these private ventures

00:16:30.769 --> 00:16:39.019
that are hoping to get manned capability.

00:16:39.019 --> 00:16:41.300
SpaceX is working on a man-rated vehicle

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:46.129
and there are others and you know we'll

00:16:46.129 --> 00:16:48.649
see what happens as as kind of the

00:16:48.649 --> 00:16:52.339
commercialization and privatization of

00:16:52.339 --> 00:16:59.379
space exploration continues to grow.

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:04.601
DARIN: And last question:

00:17:04.601 --> 00:17:06.770
What can an ordinary

00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:09.589
citizen do to contribute to the efforts

00:17:09.589 --> 00:17:11.449
to explore not only Mars but just

00:17:11.449 --> 00:17:12.574
space as a whole?

00:17:12.574 --> 00:17:14.120
ETHAN: I'd also like to ask a

00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:14.620
question after this I'm just saying

00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:25.040
DARIN: Yeah alright

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:26.870
ROB: Alright well I think in general I our society really benefits

00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:30.710
from the advances that have been made

00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:33.830
and will in future be made in technology

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:39.140
areas of aerospace and medicine you know

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:42.980
just all the branches of science and

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:48.500
space exploration is heavily dependent

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:54.770
on on our technology development and our

00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:57.110
scientific understanding continuing to

00:17:57.110 --> 00:18:00.350
evolve and continuing to grow and I

00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:02.030
think you know any endeavor in those

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:08.960
fields really helps to support its these

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:14.539
efforts to kind of explore and try to

00:18:14.539 --> 00:18:15.860
make sense of where we are in the

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:18.678
universe how we fit in.

00:18:18.678 --> 00:18:20.640
DARIN: Alright Ethan you had a question

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:24.440
ETHAN: Ah this is somewhat

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:25.850
unrelated but have you ever read the

00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:28.560
book or watch the movie the Martian?

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:30.679
ROB: Yes

00:18:30.679 --> 00:18:33.350
I've read I've not read the book I seen

00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:34.123
the movie

00:18:34.123 --> 00:18:36.440
ETHAN: Um one of the things that I

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:38.780
really liked about them of movie is it kind of

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:40.700
showed it wasn't really Science-Fiction

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:43.850
it didn't show um well future

00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:45.799
advancements but more kind of the

00:18:45.799 --> 00:18:47.299
technology we have right now. Do you

00:18:47.299 --> 00:18:48.890
agree with that do you think that it

00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:52.080
uses technology that we have today?

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:59.150
ROB: I think they there was you know there was

00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:04.880
certainly some some extreme dramatic

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:07.909
license in several areas you know that

00:19:07.909 --> 00:19:10.520
help to drive the plot but they did I

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:16.159
think get some things right in terms of

00:19:16.159 --> 00:19:19.790
the limitations of what what you can do with

00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:23.990
vehicles and you know having to have the

00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:26.600
forgot what they called it the large

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:28.160
vehicle to went back and ultimately

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:29.354
rescue the Martian.

00:19:29.354 --> 00:19:30.800
Having to have that loop

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:32.450
around the earth and wait and wait and

00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:38.510
wait for it to go back on out to Mars and

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:41.720
that was certainly what would

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:43.873
realistically have to happen.

00:19:43.873 --> 00:19:44.690
Now whether

00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:45.950
or not they would have all the supplies

00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:49.520
needed on board that they happened

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:51.740
to have in order to extend their mission

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:53.900
by months and months and months.

00:19:53.900 --> 00:20:00.650
But I thought it was a well done movie in any

00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:04.160
event.

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:05.105
ETHAN: Thank you

00:20:05.105 --> 00:20:06.890
DARIN: Um that's what we

00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:08.840
have today are Rob thank you for your

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:10.640
time um

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:14.560
ETHAN: Thank you

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:15.400
DARIN: Yeah

00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:24.000
 

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000
ROB: See you guys. Bye bye.
