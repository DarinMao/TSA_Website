				Interviews
			</h2>
		</div>
		<p>In order to gain a deeper understanding of the current situation on the privatization and exploration of Mars, as well as the rest of space, we contacted and interviewed two individuals related to the field of space exploration. We asked them the following questions:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Why do you believe it is important to explore Mars? What benefits are there?</li>
			<li>Do you think human astronauts will ever reach Mars? If so, when?</li>
			<li>What obstacles are there, both en route to Mars and on Mars? (Food, water, air, etc.)</li>
			<li>What scientific operations and explorations are the most important to make on Mars?</li>
			<li>What special problems does Mars pose to electrical and life-support systems, and to the long-term human health of any potential settlers?</li>
			<li>What special problems might a manned mission to Mars cause for the planet of Mars? (mention climate change)</li>
			<li>How will the crew of the mission be supplied? Will supplies be sent in advance, or along with the astronauts?</li>
			<li>How will the astronauts be trained for such a unique mission?</li>
			<li>Do you believe that it is important to make an effort to recover astronauts who are sent to the red planet, for use in fundraising and/or scientific use?</li>
			<li>Is there one group (SpaceX, Mars Society, etc.) you think has an advantage over the others so far?</li>
			<li>How long do you think it will be before a settlement (at least 500 people) exists on the red planet?</li>
