00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.639
BEN: So what what is your name and what was

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:04.470
your title when you're working on the US

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:05.740
Geological Survey?

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.230
EFFIE: My name is Effie Shaw

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.389
and I was a physical science technician

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.610
and I worked in the labs at the

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.309
Geological Survey, specifically the micro

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.369
paleontology lab where we looked at the

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.430
different fossils that are found in the

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.970
geologic column or the geologic cores

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.859
that we would pull out of the Earth and

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.349
from that we could age date the

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.630
different layers, so we can tell what

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.840
period of time that pollen or those

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.780
dinoflagellates or ostracods had been

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.053
deposited in the soil

00:00:40.053 --> 00:00:42.390
RYAN: So what can you

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.030
tell by looking at the soil of a planet

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.270
EFFIE: From looking at the soil of a planet

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.020
mostly you can tell when it about its

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.500
origins so from the age of the rocks

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.539
that's there, whether or not it formed

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.140
four and a half billion years ago or if it

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.539
formed after that so if it's formed in

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.420
the original Big Bang Bang explosion or

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.220
whether it was a subsequent star

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.460
explosion that it formed in by looking

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.170
at the content of what's in it and from

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.000
that also you can tell about the

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.950
geologic processes that have taken place

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.369
on that planet since its origin you can

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.630
look at the formation of comets and you

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.750
can see glacial activity on a lot of

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.860
different heavenly bodies that so you

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.960
know that it's carved out by something

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.300
such as ice so that's basically

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.420
BEN: So we we

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.090
could tell how Mars was formed how old

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.700
it was and all that

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.470
EFFIE: Yes

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.550
RYAN: Alright how do a scientist ensure sample

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.070
can get back to Earth and how do they

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.229
make sure that they aren't contaminated?

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.020
EFFIE: Okay so somehow they have to have a probe

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.060
or a drill that they'll be able to

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.360
extract the sample and the very instant

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.979
that it is extracted it has to be

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.250
contained in something such as a vacuum

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.100
a small vacuum of some kind that would

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.390
not be opened until they had it here in

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.970
a clean situation where nothing here on

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.440
Earth would contaminated because it

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.290
would be a shame to research something

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.239
that was from Mars and then find out

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:27.950
that it was actually contaminated by

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.440
something here from Earth.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.280
So a vacuum in

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.350
a clean situation and then they would

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.180
have to have a way of cleaning

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.120
of cleaning their

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.940
probes while on the other planet before

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.270
they contained the new material the next

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:50.700
sample.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.380
RYAN: So what qualities of the soil on Earth does would we be looking for on

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.640
Mars?

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.220
EFFIE: Well we would be looking for what

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.769
mineral content that it had that

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:02.959
possibly would be useful to us and in

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:04.670
particular if we were to ever set up a

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.709
colony on Mars be able to sustain

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:09.380
ourselves there we would need to have

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.630
all the minerals that the plants would

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.580
be made from because we would want to

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:14.563
use some of that we don't

00:03:14.563 --> 00:03:15.350
we're not going to take it with

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.070
us so we want to use their soil to grow

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.700
plants in that we could supply food for.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.340
BEN: Okay, thank you very much for helping

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.560
with this interview.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.900
EFFIE: And you're welcome.
