			<p>Physicists, or rather, as they're called in the industry, astrophysicists, are a highly essential part of any space mission, even though they don't take part in it. There main job, in a potential attempt to reach Mars, would likely be in determining things like how much fuel would be needed to reach the red planet, or the forces that would likely be exerted on any structure or being that came to exist on the planet.</p>
			<p>In order to become an astrophysicist, a high amount of training and experience is needed. To start off, in high, a person would need to excel in math, science, and computer science. Continuing through college, multiple internships would be extremely beneficial. Some recommended groups to intern with are physics groups or space-bound companies/organizations, such as NASA or SpaceX. In college itself, you would need to get at least a Master's degree in astrophysics		before beginning to work, and most professionals have a doctorate.</p>
			<p>The average payout in this field is abnormally high: Around $110,000 in the similar fields of astronomy and physics. Overtime, as an employee became more experienced, they would begin to earn a higher paycheck. Other options for astrophysicists are jobs in teaching, such as a professor at a university or college. Other than these areas, though, there are very few employment options for astrophysicists outside the aerospace industry.</p>
