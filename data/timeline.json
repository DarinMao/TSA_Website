Atlantis carried Galileo into Earth orbit, and then propelled Galileo on it's way to Jupiter, using a two-stage solid-fuel motor called an intertial upper stage. The final flight of the spacecraft used gravity assists to gain energy and fly towards its final destination.</p><p>En route to Jupiter, Galileo flew past Venus on February 10, 1990, and also past Earth, once on December 8, 1990, and again two years later on December 8, 1992. Galileo also flew close to two asteroids, Gaspra on October 12, 1991, and Ida on August 28, 1993. </p><p>Galileo arrived at Jupiter on December 7, 1995. After entering orbit, it dropped a probe into the atmosphere. The probe was used to measure many things, including but not limited to, temperature, pressure, vertical winds, density, and chemical composition. </p><p>The probe detected high concentrations of Argon, Krypton, and Xenon in Jupiter's atmosphere. This, it beamed back to Galileo with a huge amount of other information, which was then sent back to Earth. </p><p>Galileo orbited Jupiter and its moons for quite a long time. When it's mission finally ended on September 21, 2003, NASA crashed the spacecraft into Jupiter's atmosphere, to prevent Galileo from drifting and impacting Europa.</p>",

It's main goal was to search for clues to past water activity on Mars. </p><p>After liftoff and boost, the vehicle was inserted into a circular \"parking orbit\", after which the NASA executed the necessary maneuvers to send the spacecraft on a trajectory to Mars. After separation of the launch vehicle, acquisition by the Deep Space Network (DSN), a series of inspections, and a few post-launch commands, the spacecraft entered it's \"cruise\" stage.</p><p>During cruise, the spacecraft spins 2 rpm. Not much is done during the cruise stage; the only actions by NASA are a few health checks and some calibration and corrections. Cruise ends 45 days from entry into the Martian atmosphere. At that time, the approach stage begins. </p><p>In the approach stage, the engineers begin preparations for the entry, descent, and landing stage. The mission team makes three more correction maneuvers, and perform frequent \"Delta DOR\" measurements to ensure accurate delivery. Once the spacecraft reaches the Martian atmosphere, the entry, descent, and landing (EDL) stage begins. There are five steps to EDL (taken directly from NASA's website): <ol><li>An aeroshell and a parachute decelerate the lander through the martian atmosphere.</li><li>Prior to surface impact, retro-rockets are fired to slow the landerÂ´s speed of descent, and airbags are inflated to cushion the lander at surface impact.</li><li>After its initial impact, the lander bounces along the martian surface until it rolls to a stop.</li><li>The airbags are then deflated and retracted, and the lander petals and rover egress aids are deployed.</li><li>Once the petals have opened, the rover deploys its solar arrays, and places the system in a safe state.</li></ol></p><p>Both Spirit and it's twin Opportunity carry a Panoramic Camera, a Thermal Emission Spectrometer, a M&Ouml;ssbauer Spectrometer, an Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer, Magnets, a Microscopic Imager, and a Rock Abrasion Tool. </p><p>The goal for each rover was to drive a total of 1 kilometer (about &frac34; of a mile).
