		 "As well as being light, Sputnik was simple, as it only carried two radios and a thermometer.  </p>"+
		 "<p>After being launched, Sputnik lived a short life.  " +
		 "It transmitted radio signals for 21 days, and just 36 days later, Sputnik was destroyed while coming back into the atmosphere."+

		"It carried a cosmic ray detector for measuring the cosmic rays around earth, and to many people's surprise, it was low.  "+

		"Its length of 80in and diameter of 6.25cm also contribute to the light weight.</p>" +
		"<p>The Explorer satellite continually sent new data, until its nickel cadmium battery died on May 23, 1958.  "+
		"However, it remained in orbit until 1970, when it crashed in the Pacific Ocean on March 31 after completing 58,000 orbits around earth.  "+
		"Even with its short life, Explorer I was a major success, as it taught scientists how satellites behave around earth, and how many cosmic rays exist around earth.  </p>",
