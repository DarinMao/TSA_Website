It was a spherical shaped satellite that was made of aluminum, and it weighed a light amount of 83.6kg.  As well as being light, Sputnik was simple, as it only carried two radios and a thermometer.  </p><p>After being launched, Sputnik lived a short life.  It transmitted radio signals for 21 days, and just 36 days later, Sputnik was destroyed while coming back into the atmosphere.  Even though Sputnik had a small lifespan, it had a major impact, as its launch triggered the start of the space age.</p>",

		"Even with its instruments, Explorer I weighed significantly less with only 30.66 pounds, 18 of them being instruments.  "+
		"Its length of 80in and diameter of 6.25cm also contribute to the light weight.</p><p>The Explorer satellite continually sent new data, until its nickel cadmium battery died on May 23, 1958.  "+
		"However, it remained in orbit until 1970, when it crashed in the Pacific Ocean on March 31 after completing 58,000 orbits around earth.  "+
		"Even with its short life, Explorer I was a major success, as it taught scientists how satellites behave around earth, and how many cosmic rays exist around earth.  </p>",

The satellite weighed 202.8 kg and was 3.66m in height. It's mission was to return data on Venus's atmosphere, magnetic field, charged particle environment, and mass. </p><p>Mariner 2 had traditional solar panel wings for a constant supply of power, and it contained 1000 Watt-hour zinc batteries to store energy.  Its transmitter used the antenna dish on it to send and receive signals.  Along with those instruments, the satellite used multiple instruments for recording data, maintaining temperature, and recording data, such as its microwave radiometer.</p><p>With these instruments, the spacecraft discovered that Venus has a hot surface temperatures, a high surface pressure, mostly carbon dioxide for its atmosphere, a layer of clouds at about 60km altitude, and it has no magnetic field.  Estimates on its mass were also inferred.</p>",

It had four legs attached to a cylindrical body with many other tools for studying the lunar mass, such as a drill and an extendable arm.  These were useful in collecting sample soil from the moon, for investigating it at a later time on earth.</p><p>Luna 16 began its descent to the moon on September 20, and it had a successful, soft landing.  About a day later, after it had collected samples, the lander was picked up.  Then, on September 24, it made a safe landing to earth.</p>",

It takes photos using infared and ultraviolet sensors from the exosphere, which does not have many contaminants.  </p><p>To carry all of these sensors, Hubble needs considerable size, which is why it measures 43 feet in length and 14 feet in width.  Not only does it hold a multitude of sensors, but it has two mirrors and support systems that help the telescope focus.  Finally, the essential antenna allows the telescope to keep in constant communication with NASA, so that it can send back data.</p>",
