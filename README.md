# TSA Website
The website for TSA.
We will research first, so do not make any changes to these files yet.  (Except for basic style and html changes)

IMPORTANT: DO NOT MAKE CHANGES DIRECTLY TO MASTER. If you are working on anything, branch master and commit to that instead.
If you are just adding a few lines that will not need any debugging, you can commit to master.

ALSO VERY IMPORTANT: STOP DELETING THE PHP CODE! PHP is server side code, so you can only see garbage if you are viewing the files locally. You can only see the PHP code working at the server below.

View the site at: <a href="https://mission-to-mars.000webhostapp.com/" target="_blank">https://mission-to-mars.000webhostapp.com/</a> This IS NOT updated automatically, so ask Darin to and he'll get it done within a minute.
### As you are developing, make sure that you are using correct markup. <a href="https://validator.w3.org/unicorn/check?ucn_uri=mission-to-mars.000webhostapp.com&tests=valnu&tests=css-validator&warning=1&profile=css3&usermedium=all&ucn_task=custom#" target="_blank">Check Here</a>

# Plans
